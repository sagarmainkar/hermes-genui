"""Serves stored blocks to the Desktop half: GET /api/plugins/hermes-genui/blocks/<id>, plus what the user did to
them (a checklist's ticks): GET and PUT /blocks/<id>/state. Desktop asks the active profile for every board, so a board
missing from this profile's store is looked up in the other profiles' stores (store.find_root), and its ticks are kept
beside it there.

Hermes imports this file on its own (not as part of the plugin package), so core/store.py is loaded by path
(it imports nothing from the package).
